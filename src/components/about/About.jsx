      <p className="about-section">
        An energetic, dedicated, and highly focused individual with a solid
        understanding of software development, databases, and maintenance of
        complex and critical systems by completing a 16-week software developer
        bootcamp at MAKERS, London. Aspiring to start the next challenging
        career as a junior software developer within a tech-oriented environment
        to develop further skills and experiences. Creative mindset particularly
        around deployment models and emerging technologies with an aptitude for
        innovation. Immense knowledge of object-oriented concepts and
        programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.

      <p className="about-section">
        My journey into software development began with my enrolment in the
        highly selective Makers Academy, where I underwent intensive training in
        cutting-edge development practices. This immersive programme emphasised
        object-oriented programming (OOP), Agile methodologies, test-driven
        development (TDD), and the importance of pair programming. This
        experience not only equipped me with a solid technical foundation but
        also honed my abilities in collaboration, communication, and
        problem-solving.

      <p className="about-section">
        My career prior to transitioning into software development spanned a
        decade across various industries, including real estate, food retailing,
        and hospitality. This diverse background has enriched my skill set with
        a wealth of soft skills, such as adaptability, effective communication,
        and problem-solving. I believe these attributes, coupled with my
        technical expertise, make me a well-rounded candidate ready to excel in
        a collaborative tech environment.
